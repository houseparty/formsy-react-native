# formsy-react-native
A form input builder and validator for React-Native (based on formsy-react)

This project was inspired by the original [formsy-react](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react) made for React. After having worked on a few small projects in React Native and explored the existing form solutions out there (tcomb, redux-form- to name a few), I thought it would be fantastic to port Formsy in all it's glory, to work almost identical to its original implementationâ€“ so this is it!

Additional documentation is on its way...

For now, please check out the [example app](./examples) by running `yarn` in the `/examples` folder, then `yarn run ios`.
